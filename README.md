# Escape Room web game
As commissioned by a client working with the NHS, this game was designed as an educational tool to run an online game which many users could join, to interact with live to answer questions in order to ultimately 'escape' the scenario. The teacher would have a different live view which displays the position of each team as well as the ending scene ranking them once the game has been completed.
